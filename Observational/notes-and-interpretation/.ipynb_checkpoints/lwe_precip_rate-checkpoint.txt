The abbreviation "lwe" means liquid water equivalent. "Precipitation rate" means the depth or thickness of the layer formed by precipitation per unit time.

lwe precipitation rate is also called radar precipitation rate.

Precipitation rate is the amount of precipitation that is collected over a specific time period; usually measured in inches/hour or millimeters/hour.

Liquid Water Equivalent
Same as Water Equivalent; the liquid content of solid precipitation that has accumulated on the ground (snow depth). The accumulation may consist of snow, ice formed by freezing precipitation, freezing liquid precipitation, or ice formed by the refreezing of melted snow.


Radar precipitation rate, also known as radar-derived precipitation rate, is an estimation of the amount of precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, etc.) that is falling at a particular location based on data from a radar system.

Radar systems emit electromagnetic waves that bounce off precipitation particles in the atmosphere, allowing the radar to detect the presence and movement of precipitation. By analyzing the characteristics of the radar signal, such as its intensity and frequency, meteorologists can estimate the precipitation rate at a particular location.

Radar precipitation rate is commonly used in weather forecasting and hydrological modeling, as it provides valuable information about the intensity and distribution of precipitation over a given area. It can also be used to track the movement of storms and to help identify potential areas of flooding or other weather-related hazards.



To calculate the extent of overestimation in model precipitation and underestimation in radar precipitation, you can use a simple comparison method. Here's a step-by-step process:

1. Obtain the precipitation data from both the model and the radar for the same time period and location.

2. Calculate the average precipitation value from the model data. Let's call this value M_avg.

3. Calculate the average precipitation value from the radar data. Let's call this value R_avg.

4. Calculate the difference between M_avg and R_avg. This will give you the overall bias between the model and radar data.

   Bias = M_avg - R_avg

   If the bias is positive, it indicates that the model overestimates the precipitation. If it's negative, it means the radar underestimates the precipitation.

5. Additionally, you can calculate the percentage overestimation and underestimation by comparing the average precipitation values:

   Percentage Overestimation = ((M_avg - R_avg) / R_avg) * 100

   Percentage Underestimation = ((R_avg - M_avg) / M_avg) * 100

   These percentages provide a relative measure of the difference between the two precipitation estimates.

It's worth noting that this method provides an overall assessment of the bias between the model and radar precipitation. If you want to analyze the bias in more detail, you may need to consider other statistical methods or compare the precipitation values at different quantiles or thresholds.
