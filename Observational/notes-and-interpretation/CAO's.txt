Open cellular convection, also known as open cellular cells, is a type of atmospheric circulation pattern that occurs in the polar regions during the winter months. It is characterized by the formation of distinctive hexagonal shapes in cloud formations that can be seen from space.

Open cellular convection occurs when cold, dry air moves over the relatively warmer ocean surface in the polar regions. The air cools further, and as it does so, it sinks, creating high pressure areas. This sinking air then spreads out in a radial pattern, causing the formation of the hexagonal cells. The center of each cell is a region of high pressure, while the edges are regions of low pressure where warm, moist air rises.

The hexagonal shape of the cells is thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including the rotation of the Earth, the presence of moisture in the atmosphere, and the interaction between different layers of the atmosphere.

Open cellular convection is an important phenomenon in the polar regions, as it plays a role in the exchange of heat, moisture, and gases between the atmosphere and the ocean. It can also have an impact on weather patterns in other parts of the world, as the circulation patterns can affect the flow of air and weather systems at higher latitudes.

Roll clouds and open cellular clouds are two different types of cloud formations that are caused by different atmospheric processes.

Roll clouds are a type of low-level, horizontal cloud formation that appears to be rolling along a horizontal axis, giving them their characteristic tubular or cylindrical shape. Roll clouds are usually associated with thunderstorms or cold fronts, and they are created by the movement of cold air from a thunderstorm or weather front that is moving over a warmer surface, such as a body of water or land. The cold air mass is denser than the surrounding warm air, and as it moves forward, it lifts the warm air, creating a series of rising and sinking air currents that result in the formation of the tube-like cloud.

On the other hand, open cellular clouds are a type of cloud formation that occurs in the polar regions during the winter months. They are characterized by the formation of distinctive hexagonal shapes in cloud formations that can be seen from space. Open cellular convection occurs when cold, dry air moves over the relatively warmer ocean surface in the polar regions. The air cools further, and as it does so, it sinks, creating high pressure areas. This sinking air then spreads out in a radial pattern, causing the formation of the hexagonal cells.

So, while roll clouds are low-level, horizontal tube-like clouds that are associated with thunderstorms or cold fronts, open cellular clouds are high-level, hexagonal clouds that are associated with cold, dry air moving over warmer ocean surfaces in the polar regions.

Level I, Level II, and Level III data are different levels of processed data that are used in various scientific disciplines, including remote sensing, atmospheric sciences, and climate research.

Level I data refers to raw data that is collected by instruments, such as satellite sensors or weather radars. This data is usually in a format that is specific to the instrument and may contain various artifacts or errors.

Level II data refers to processed data that has been derived from Level I data, which has undergone some level of calibration and correction for various errors and artifacts. Level II data may include additional information, such as geolocation data or atmospheric properties, that have been derived from the Level I data.

Level III data refers to data products that have been derived from Level II data and are in a format that is more user-friendly and suitable for analysis and interpretation. Level III data often includes georeferencing information and may be presented in various formats, such as maps or images, that are more accessible to non-specialists.

In summary, Level I data is raw data, Level II data is processed data, and Level III data is derived data products that are more user-friendly and suitable for analysis and interpretation.
