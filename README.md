## Project Overview
I am actively engaged in the project titled **"Cold Air Outbreak, Convective Cell Tracking, and Life Cycle Study"**. This project is a part of the Cold Air Outbreaks in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (COMBLE), an extensive field campaign conducted under the auspices of the United States Department of Energy's (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program.

### COMBLE Campaign
- **Duration:** December 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020
- **Objective:** To advance our understanding of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions and the atmospheric dynamics within the Marine Cold Air Outbreak (MCAO) cloud regime.

## My Role
As a researcher, my primary focus is on:
- **Tracking Open-Cellular Convective Cells:** I am responsible for tracking these cells from the edge of the Arctic to Andenes, approximately 1200 km from the Arctic ice edge, to study their characteristics and dynamics.

### Tools and Methodologies
- **Tracking and Object-Based Analysis of Clouds (TOBAC):** Utilized for tracking open-cellular cells within the C-Band radar and analyzing their evolution.
- **Cloud Identification:** Employed the Ka-Band ARM Zenith Radar (KAZR) for identifying open-cellular cells and their structures.

## Contributions and Findings
- **Analysis of Open-Cellular Convection:** Presented preliminary results for open-cellular convection during COMBLE, focusing on a significant MCAO case from March 2020.
- **Horizontal Cloud Structure Analysis:** Tracked and analyzed parameters such as maximum and mean reflectivity, area, and temporal growth of convective cells, especially those transitioning to landfall.
- **Observations of Cellular Dynamics:** Observed general weakening in reflectivity and cell size reduction as cells approached landfall, suggesting environmental influences and merging of less intense cells.
- **Precipitation Rate Comparison:** Conducted a 21-hour comparison of observed and simulated precipitation rates, noting intensification near coastlines and possible orographic enhancement.
- **Vertical Cloud Structure Analysis:** Identified and categorized 57 open cellular cells into developing, mature, and decaying stages, providing insights into storm development and decay dynamics.
- **Lifecycle Stage Analysis:** Analyzed how liquid water path, precipitation rate, and temperature anomaly corresponded to the different lifecycle stages of a cell, offering insights into the cooling effect and precipitation processes at each stage.
